# TINY-ViT: Vision Transformer from Scratch

## Introduction
TINY-ViT offers a minimalist, yet complete implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for computer vision tasks. This project aims to provide a clear and structured approach to building Vision Transformers, making it accessible for educational purposes and practical applications alike.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of components like data processing, model architecture, and training routines.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt the architecture and data pipeline for various datasets and applications.
- **Poetry Dependency Management**: Utilizes Poetry for simple and reliable package management.

## Installation
To install the project and its dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage
### Training
To train the model using the default configuration:

```bash
poetry run python train.py
```

### Fine-Tuning
To fine-tune a pre-trained model:

```bash
poetry run python finetune.py
```
