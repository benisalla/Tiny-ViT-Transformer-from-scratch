## About The Project 📖

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://yourimageurl.com/vit-architecture.png" width="600" height="300"/>
</div>

TINY-ViT offers a minimalist, yet complete implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for computer vision tasks. This project aims to provide a clear and structured approach to building Vision Transformers, making it accessible for educational purposes and practical applications alike.





---




## Features
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of components like data processing, model architecture, and training routines.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt the architecture and data pipeline for various datasets and applications.
- **Poetry Dependency Management**: Utilizes Poetry for simple and reliable package management.
